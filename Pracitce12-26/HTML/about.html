        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            <b>
                I worked in the casino industry for 12 years after serving 4 in the US Navy.<br />
                I am currently attending school and am almost done with my AAS. <br />
                Learning new tech always makes me smile.  I’ve learned to develop applications using MVC,<br />
                and C# combined with database applications with Microsoft access and SQL server.<br />
                VBA code for more robust Windows productivity apps. I've learned to build web pages <br />
                with HTML\CSS\Javascript to make myself as close to full stack as possible. <br />

        <h2>About This Website</h2>
        <p>
            <b>
                This page started off as a way to practice the Javascript and CSS that I learned in the<br />
                client-side scripting class I took in the fall 2019 quarter. Then it just organically evolved<br />
                as I started to add more and more stuff. At the time of writing this it currently contains<br />
                CSS, HTML, and Javascript. By the time I finish I will have multiple JS libraries, some C# <br />
                code for business logic, and it will all be connected to a SQL Server DB.
